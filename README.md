## Reflection 1

You already implemented two new features using Spring Boot. Check again your source code and evaluate the coding standards that you have learned in this module. Write clean code principles and secure coding practices that have been applied to your code.  If you find any mistake in your source code, please explain how to improve your code. Please write your reflection inside the repository's README.md file.

(mohon maaf kalau Inggris saya jelek) I've learned that the module for this project provides a good basis for coding practices and clean code principles. Following the module and its style of coding, I've improved in noticing and connecting the relationship between files. Albeit, I still found it pretty inconvenient to create many files and track or change them when there's a problem occurred. Not only that, the IDE is new to me, and it's challenging to get used to since it doesn't have a good display, missing shortcuts, and lag. So I have to just get used to it first, then realize it provides much more than VS Code, it tells where the problems are in different files easily. 

Since clean code principles are somewhat dependent on a programmer's preference, I don't think it matches my way of reading the lines from the code. I usually use a highlight extension in VSCode, which highlights the comments and important codes to easily help me read it, making it easy to create long lines of code without getting confused, but since this is a learning opportunity, I'll try my best to suit myself coding using the principles.

## Reflection 2

1. After writing the unit test, how do you feel? How many unit tests should be made in a class? How to make sure that our unit tests are enough to verify our program? It would be good if you learned about code coverage. Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested. If you have 100% code coverage, does that mean your code has no bugs or errors? 

I think the tests are more required in more complex projects. The tests in my program don't differ from testing it manually rendering it useless and less efficient, but I can see that once the project gets more complex, the tests will be very helpful. 

To make sure that the unit tests are enough to verify the program is by trying out many different situations that the program is not intended to, therefore, you can easily find bugs and errors. It doesn't mean that code has no bugs or errors if it has 100% code coverage, there are many ways to break the code from what the code can handle. Although, if it's a simple project, maybe it could have no bugs or errors, but there may be errors or bugs that haven't been found or known to cause yet.

2. Suppose that after writing the CreateProductFunctionalTest.java along with the corresponding test case, you were asked to create another functional test suite that verifies the number of items in the product list. You decided to create a new Java class similar to the prior functional test suites with the same setup procedures and instance variables. What do you think about the cleanliness of the code of the new functional test suite? Will the new code reduce the code quality? Identify the potential clean code issues, explain the reasons, and suggest possible improvements to make the code cleaner! Please write your reflection inside the repository's README.md file.

I think it will clutter the test files too much, if you need to create a new file only for several items especially if you keep track of the number of items, creating the program in the same file can be better. For example, after creating the product, add another test if the number of items is increased or not and verify it. Creating the same setup procedures and instance variables for every test in the future could potentially slow down the time it took to test the project. 

The cleanliness of the code will probably look good, but navigating the projects with other codes will be hard. The new code wouldn't reduce the code quality, since it has the same setup, perhaps if the setup before is already bad, then it will be bad, but if it's good, then probably not. If we're talking about the test file quality then probably yes, but ultimately not, since it can provide for future tests that can be created or occur with relatable problems. The potential clean code issues are the new functional test is not as good as the prior, it doesn't provide readability of the code, efficiency while maintaining trackability, and many more. 

The possible improvements are as such:
- make sure the code is readable for everyone, especially on the team
- it is trackable for any potential problems that may occur
- efficient with the code
- if the test can be run in the same file as another test and can cut down the time, then it's probably better to create it in the same file
